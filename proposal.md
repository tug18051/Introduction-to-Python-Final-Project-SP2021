# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Power Pong

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A pong game with power ups that are rewarded by completing a typing challenge; typing the given sentence with the correct grammar and punctuation. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This project will be the game Pong with a twist. There will be power ups that will give the player or cpu an advantage at the game. 
Some of the power ups could be: a wider pong paddle, a narrower goal, unrestricted paddle movement, faster paddle movement, etc. 
The way to achieve these power ups would be to complete a typing challenge. The player will be given a random sentence that must be typed as shown, any errors will result in no power up.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A functional game of pong that that has at least one power up or one feature that makes it different from original pong.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A functional game of pong that has a handful of different power ups and a challenge in order to achieve the power up.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A functional game of pong that has different power ups, a challenge to achieve the power ups, can play against a CPU with varying difficulties or another player.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My first step will be to complete the pong track provided on canvas. Then the different power ups will be added. Then a challenge to achieve the power ups will be added next.
I will need to learn how to use LOVE. I will research what is possible with using LOVE. If LOVE is not sufficient enough, I may have to look into using other methods of programming or other programs to use.
