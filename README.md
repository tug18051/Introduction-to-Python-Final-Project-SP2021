# Introduction-to-Python-Final-Project-SP2021

My final project is a pong game with power ups. 

It is called Power Pong.

Here is the link to the youtube video.

Initially, I wanted the power ups to be awarded to a player by having them score and type a sentence that pops up with correct grammar. If the player made an error, he/she would not be able to backspace and would have to give up the power up. I was not able to code in a textbox properly and get lua to read the input. Instead I decided to give the power ups to the player after scoring one point.

Working on this project showed me how tedious coding can be. It isn't as easy as it may seem but it also isn't as hard as I thought before I took this class. I thought coding would be extremely difficult, like learning another spoken language. It wasn't easy coding for increased height in the paddles. At first, I thought it would be as simple as setting the paddle to new parameters once a certain condition was met. This was not the case. I realized that I had to call the paddle class again and create an entirely new paddle that would replace the old one once the condition was met. Then after replacing, I realized that the movement, collision, and rendering needed to be coded for the new paddle. Each new iteration and new power up coded in took a lot of time to think about what needed to be added, a lot of time to debug, and a lot of grammar checking to get the right syntax. It was tedious but it was also very rewarding to have at least completed some of what I wanted to achieve. I tested, learned, and understood a lot through trial and error and overall, it was still fun to work on this project.
