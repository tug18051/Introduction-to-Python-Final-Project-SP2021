# Introduction-to-Python-Final-Project-SP2021

My final project is a pong game with power ups. 

It is called Power Pong.

Initially, I wanted the power ups to be awarded to a player by having them score and type a sentence that pops up with correct grammar. If the player made an error, he/she would not be able to backspace and would have to give up the power up. I was not able to code in a textbox properly and get lua to read the input. Instead I decided to give the power ups to the player after scoring one point.

Here is the link to the youtube video.
