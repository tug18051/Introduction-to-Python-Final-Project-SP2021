# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Create pong but with power ups - in order to get the power up, players will have to type a given sentence, without error, and whoever does it first gets a random power up. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is this possible to do in python, or will I have to use another coding software?
